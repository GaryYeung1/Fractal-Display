To run our program you must click on the main class and run it as a java application
With the OurScanner class you must put in the escape distance to actually see the fractal.
So look down at the console to input the integer value.
Please ignore the jtextfield and the jbutton they don't get the escape distance for you.
Also if you want to put in a new escape distance, you must rerun the program through the main class.
The multibrot set takes a while to load so please wait patiently.
Running our tests is probably the most annoying part. You have to constantly 
put in an escape Distance for the tests to work.
So we suggest inputing the same integer over and over again until all tests are completed.
Thank you.
