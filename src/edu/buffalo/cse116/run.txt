To run our program you must click on the main class and run it as a java application
With the jtextfield and set button you must put in the escape distance, number of workers
and escape time to actually change the fractal. You must also drag the mouse to where you want 
to zoom in and reload the fractal.
The reset button changes back to the fractal you initially started with. 
You must reload the fractal by clicking on the menu bar containing the fractal. So after you 
put in the escape time, escape distance, and number of workers, go to fractal and click on the 
fractal you are currently on.   
The multibrot set takes a while to load so please wait patiently.
The mouseDragListener class creates a mouse listener and a mouse motion listener. It gets the 
coordinates of the mouse and attemps to show the user where the mouse is dragging. It will 
tell you it's coordinates in the console. It also helps you to zoom in.

also ignore the our scanner class, we have it in here because the last time we didn't submit it 
our code crashed. :)
Thank you.
